My research has two main foci: language variation and change, particularly in the varieties of 
English in the Southern United States, and the perception of phonetic processes. My work has examined variation in 
the Appalachian region, with an emphasis on vocalic and intonational variation. I examine the effect 
that socio-indexical aspects of individuals have on various phonetic processes. Also, I 
have investigated various phonetic processes and how they affect or impact the perception and 
processing of speech. Here, you can find materials relevant to my published research and presentations.

I provide full links for these papers that have appeared and to presentations and posters.  
[My CV](http://paulereed.github.io/cv/) contains more information about other projects that
are in various stages of the publication process.
