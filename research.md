My research has two main foci: language variation and change, particularly in the varieties of 
English in the Southern United States, and the perception of phonetic processes. My work has examined variation in 
the Appalachian region, with an emphasis on vocalic and intonational variation. I examine the effect 
that socio-indexical aspects of individuals have on various phonetic processes. Also, I 
have investigated various phonetic processes and how they affect or impact the perception and 
processing of speech. Some of these processes are locus equations, the impact of noise, 
how signal degradation and speech rate affects connected speech perception, and syllable structure.

Other areas of interest are statistical analysis, particularly mixed effects models and other
hierarchical linear models. I have served as a statistical consultant for several projects, from
the acquisition of spelling to lipreading.

Outside of my phonetic work, I have investigated other aspects of the linguistics of Southern American English, primarily the syntax of multiple modals, negation, and auxiliary movement. 
In a related vein, I am the co-director, with Michael Montgomery, of
*[MultiMo](http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/multimo/){:target='_blank'}*, a searchable database of published and unpublished tokens of multiple modals.

Here, you can find materials relevant to my published research and presentations.

I provide full links for these papers that have appeared and to presentations and posters.  
[My CV](http://paulereed.github.io/cv/) contains more information about other projects that
are in various stages of the publication process.
