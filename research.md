My research focuses on language variation and change, particularly in the varieties of 
English in the Southern United States. My principal research interest is the variation in 
the Appalachian region, with an emphasis on vocalic and intonational variation. I examine the effect 
that socio-indexical aspects of individuals have on various phonetic processes. 
Here, you can find materials relevant to my published research and presentations.

I provide full links for these papers when I believe they are ready for peer review. 
Feel free to contact me if you are interested in some of these projects.
