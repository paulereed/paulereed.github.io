I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Language Processing Laboratory in the Department
of Communication Sciences and Disorders at the University of South Carolina. My research
interests primarily center on sociophonetics, i.e., how the way we talk signals aspects of
who we are. My focus is on the English varieties in the American South, with a special 
focus on Appalachian English varieties.

Outside of academia, I am an avid reader and sports fan. I love Southern and Appalachian
literature, and I can be found cheering on the Volunteers of my home state of Tennessee
in pretty much every sport!
