I am an assistant professor in the Department
of Communicative Disorders at the University of Alabama. My research
interests primarily center on sociophonetics, i.e., how the way we talk signals aspects of
who we are, and also phonetics more broadly, particularly the phonetics/phonology interface. 
Much of my sociophonetic work focuses on the English varieties in the 
American South, with a special focus on Appalachian English varieties. 

Aside from phonetics, I am an advocate for the Appalachian region as a whole. I am 
co-director, with Michael Montgomery, of the Appalachian English [website](http://artsandsciences.sc.edu/engl/dictionary/){:target='_blank'}. 
This site helps to educate both linguists and interested laypersons about the features of 
and variation within Appalachian English.

Outside of academia, I am an avid reader and sports fan. I love Southern and Appalachian
literature, and I can be found cheering on the Volunteers of my home state of Tennessee
in pretty much every sport!
