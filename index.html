<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information about my current research and teaching. 
	Information about the classes that I teach is available under the Teaching tab. 
	Iâ€™m currently an Assistant Professor and the Director of Undergraduate Studies in the
	 <a href="http://www.cd.ua.edu" target="_blank">Department of Communicative Disorders</a> 
	 at <a href="http://www.ua.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Alabama</a>.</p>
	<p>My research and teaching interests include phonetics and sociophonetics, sociolinguistics, 
	speech perception and language processing, and other aspects of Southern and Appalachian Englishes. 
	In particular, my current research agenda focuses on how individual-level social attributes are expressed phonetically, 
	centering on vocalic and prosodic variation. My research has been published in journals like 
	the <em>Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</em>, <em>American Speech</em>, and 
	the <em>Southern Journal of Linguistics</em>.</p>
